# promt_engine
Prompt Review Engine: Build a local web app: user enters a prompt → app maps it to
COSTAR (Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, Response) → rule engine returns a
verdict (ALLOW / NEEDS_FIX / BLOCK) with reasons and a sanitized prompt → a broker
forwards only ALLOW to a chosen LLM (or a stub). One command launches everything.
